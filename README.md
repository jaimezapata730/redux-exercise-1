# redux-exercise-1
In this exercise, you will build a mood changer app that uses redux to alter the mood of a text emoji, as shown below:

You should use the starter index.html boilerplate.

You can use whatever ASCII faces you want. You can find a complete list of options here. Note that the app starts with a default ASCII face that doesnâ€™t correspond do any of the moods.

Remember that since you are using Redux, your reducer must be a pure function. Your actions should include a payload with the new face.

For DOM manipulation you can use raw JavaScript or JQuery. Redux has been provided for you in a script tag within the starter code.
